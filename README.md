# HTML Email Starting Structure

This `index.html` file was combined to shorten the time of the HTML Email markup creation.<br />

## What does the file contains?
In the `<head>` there are all the cases which can normalize the page for different Email APIs.<br />
In the `<body>` there are normalize styles and basic `<table>` structure to start with.<br />
In the commented area under `</html>` tag there are several basic HTML Email elements, which can appear in the design - buttons, separation lines, links, background image hacks etc.<br />
Also there are 2 templates for **two-column** and **fluid** layots for the HTML Email letter.

## How to use it?
You can start placing your own HTML Email `<table>` inside the `<td>` at line `109`.<br />
For using standart elements like buttons, links, fluid tables etc just copypaste commented `html` and customize for your own needs.<br /><br />

*Many thanks!*
